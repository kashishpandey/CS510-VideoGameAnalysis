# Midterm-Coding-Project

How to run program: 
- Clone the repo from GitHub
- Open the r project in r studio 
- Select all the code (command-A)
- Hit the run button 
* note that it may take a few minutes to run all the models towards the bottom of the code because of model complexity

Things I plan on adding/ working on:
- adding more descriptive comments after each chunk of code 
- adding a few more graphs
- improving graphs further (adding theme_minimal, seeing if I can better convey the data in a different type of graph, titles, coloring the bars etc)
- hyper parameter tuning for all the models 
- seeing which models I should keep/get rid of 
- adding different measurements for models (maybe accuracy, mse, mae, etc)
